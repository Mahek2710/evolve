# **evolve**

*A focused platform for problem-solving and interview readiness*

---

## **Overview**

**Evolve** is a web-based coding platform designed to bridge the gap between casual practice and real technical interviews.
It offers two distinct modes—**Build** and **Perform**—to help users improve problem-solving skills and evaluate interview readiness under realistic constraints.

Unlike traditional coding platforms, Evolve emphasizes **decision-making, time management, and communication**, not just correct answers.

---

## **Key Modes**

### **1. Build (Practice Mode)**

Build is a structured problem-solving environment focused on skill development and consistency.

**What it offers:**

* Curated set of coding problems with increasing difficulty
* Real-time code execution (JavaScript supported)
* Persistent code storage per problem
* Test case visibility for better debugging
* Problem completion tracking
* Smooth navigation between problems

**Purpose:**
To help users practice deliberately, refine logic, and build confidence without time pressure.

---

### **2. Perform (Interview Mode)**

Perform simulates a real technical interview experience.

**What it offers:**

* Timed interview sessions
* Persona-based interviewer setup (Product company, Startup, etc.)
* Sequential problem flow
* One-time submission constraint per problem
* Real-time timer tracking
* Automated interview scoring

**Purpose:**
To evaluate how users perform under pressure—mirroring real interview conditions.

---

## **Interview Evaluation & Feedback**

After each interview session, users receive a detailed feedback report including:

* **Problem-wise results** (Passed / Not Submitted / Failed)
* **Time spent per problem**
* **Correctness score**
* **Time management score**
* **Code quality score**
* **Communication score** (via interviewer interruptions)
* **Overall performance score**

This ensures feedback goes beyond just “right or wrong.”

---

## **Core Features**

* **Dual-mode architecture**: Separate workflows for practice and interviews
* **Local persistence**: User code and session state stored reliably
* **Smooth transitions**: Clean navigation and UI transitions
* **Minimal, distraction-free editor**
* **Keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation**
* **Full-screen coding support**
* **Interview session recovery** (in case of refresh or interruption)

---

## **Google Technologies Used**

* **Firebase Authentication**

  * Google OAuth for secure sign-in
* **Firebase Firestore**

  * Stores interview sessions, problem states, and feedback
* **Firebase Hosting**

  * Deploys the application with global availability
* **Google Cloud Infrastructure**

  * Ensures scalability and reliability

---

## **Why Evolve Is Different**

* Separates **practice** and **performance** instead of mixing them
* Simulates interview pressure realistically
* Evaluates **communication and reasoning**, not just code
* Provides structured feedback instead of generic success/failure
* Designed for interview readiness, not leaderboard chasing

---

## **Future Enhancements**

### **Build Mode**

* Multi-language execution support (Java, Python, C++)
* Topic-based problem filters
* Adaptive problem recommendations
* Optional guided hints after failed attempts

### **Perform Mode**

* Richer communication analysis
* Multiple interviewer interruptions per problem
* Difficulty adjustment based on performance
* Session replay with timeline view

### **Platform-Level**

* Analytics dashboard for long-term progress
* Personalized practice plans
* Exportable interview reports

---

## **Target Users**

* Students preparing for technical interviews
* Developers transitioning to product-based roles
* Anyone seeking structured interview practice

---

## **Conclusion**

Evolve is not just a coding platform—it’s an **interview readiness system**.
By separating learning from evaluation, it enables users to practice smarter and perform better when it matters most.
