# 🚀 evolve - Interview & Coding Practice Platform

Evolve is a web-based platform designed to help students and developers **practice coding problems** and **simulate real technical interviews** with structured workflows, timing, and communication checkpoints.

Built for hackathons, interview preparation, and skill assessment — **beyond just solving problems.**

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 Build Mode (Practice)
- Solve DSA problems in an interactive code editor
- Real-time test case execution
- Clear success feedback with visual celebration
- Retry problems or return to problem list
- Progress-focused learning environment

---

### 🎯 Interview Mode (Core Highlight)
A **realistic interview simulation** designed to mimic actual technical interviews.

#### ⏱️ Timed Interview Sessions
- Configurable interview duration
- Live countdown timer
- Auto-end when time expires

#### 🧩 Multi-Problem Interview Flow
- Automatically selects:
  - problems based on difficulty depending upon the role applied
- Seamless transition between problems
- Per-problem time tracking

---

### 🗣️ Communication Evaluation (Unique Feature)
Evolve evaluates **how candidates communicate**, not just whether they get the answer.

#### Structured Communication Checkpoints:
1. **Understanding** — Explain the problem in your own words  
2. **Approach & Reasoning** — Describe your strategy and logic  
3. **Reflection** — Discuss trade-offs, optimizations, and alternatives  

All responses are:
- Stored per problem
- Displayed transparently in feedback
- Not auto-scored numerically (to avoid unfair judgment)

---

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Feedback (Optional)
- Uses **Google Gemini** to generate qualitative feedback on communication
- Provides:
  - Overall assessment
  - Strengths
  - Areas of improvement
  - Interview tips
- No code correctness judgment by AI
- Designed to assist human review, not replace it

---

### 📊 Interview Feedback Dashboard
After the interview:
- Persona summary
- Total time used
- Problem-wise results
- Candidate-written communication responses
- Optional AI-generated communication analysis
- Clear call-to-action to retry or start a new interview

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (React Framework)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Framer Motion** (smooth transitions)
- **CodeMirror** (code editor)

### Backend / Platform
- **Firebase Authentication**
- **Firebase Firestore**
- **LocalStorage** (session persistence)

### Google Technologies Used

- **Google Gemini (Generative AI)** — Communication feedback generation

---

## 🧪 Problem Evaluation
- Custom handler functions per problem
- Secure execution for JavaScript solutions
- Language selector UI (JS supported; others marked “coming soon”)

---

## 🎯 Why Evolve?
Most platforms only test **correctness**.

Evolve focuses on:
- Problem solving
- Time management
- Communication clarity
- Interview readiness

It’s not just about **getting the answer** — it’s about **explaining it like a real interview**.
